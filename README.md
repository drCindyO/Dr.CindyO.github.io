## Projects
**EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS; June 25, 2023**
- 	Performed exploratory data analysis using python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn and matplotlib to provide insights for Foodhub							       		
- Foodhub: food aggregator company looking to get an idea about the demand of different restaurants which will help them in enhancing their customer experience 			        		
- Visualized and analyzed the data and was able to provide insights such as the most profitable cuisines and restaurants, delivery trends during weekends and weekdays and lowest total order time
- Provided recommendations on how to improve ratings and delivery service

**STATISTICAL INFERENCE AND HYPOTHESIS TESTING WITH PYTHON; July 30, 2023**
- Performed statistical analysis, a/b testing, and visualization to decide whether the new landing page of an online news portal (E-news Express)							       		
- Utilized python libraries including Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib and Scipy			        		
- Visualized the data, conducted exploratory data analysis and conducted hypothesis testing to address the statistical concerns
- The issues addressed include the decision on which landing page is better, concluding whether language affects the choice of landing page, and deciding which of the pages has a higher conversion rate

**LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL WITH PYTHON; Aug.27, 2023**
- Built a linear regression model to predict the price of used phones/tablets and identify the influencing factors
- Utilized python libraries including numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn and statsmodels in order to train the data to identify final linear regression model
- Key factors that influence pricing were identified and recommendations were offered on how profit can be maximize to benefit the business					       		
  
**LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL WITH PYTHON; Sep.24, 2023**
- Built Logistic regression model and decision tree models to predict whether or not a booking will be canceled and identify influencing factors
- Built a decision tree from the data set, pre-pruned by grid search hyper-parameter tuning and post pruned using minimal cost complexity pruning
- Identified the key factors influencing the booking status and offered recommendations on policies that can maximize profit in the event of a cancelation								       		
 
**ENSEMBLE TECHNIQUES (BAGGING, BOOSTING AND STACKING WITH PYTHON); Oct.15, 2023**
- Built various machine learning models including bagging classifier, random forest classifier, adaboost, Gboost, Xgboost and Stacking classifier models to predict whether or not a visa application will be 
      certified							       		
- Utilized python libraries including numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn and statsmodels			        		
- Built models from the data, after which the hyper parameters were tuned to get the model with the best performance
   
**MODEL TUNING: OVERSAMPLING, UNDERSAMPLING, HYPERPARAMETER TUNING AND PIPELINE BUILDING; Nov.05; 2023**
- Built and tuned six ensemble models to predict the failures of wind turbines and save maintenance cost							       		
- Performed undersampling and oversampling, tuned the models, identified the best model and built a pipeline to productionalize the final model			        		
- Identified most important features of the model and offered some recommendations for saving maintenance cos

**UNSUPERVISED LEARNING: KMEANS CLUSTERING AND HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING OF STOCK SECURITIES; Nov.16, 2023**
- Clustered various stock securities based on their Price change, Cash ratio, EPS, P/E ratios etc using Kmeans clustering and hierarchical clustering algorithms on python							       		
- Utilized the average distortion and silhouette scores to estimate the best number of clusters for K means clustering 			        		
- Utilized cophenetic correlations and dendograms to determine the best way to hierarchically cluster the data
- Conducted recommendations on how to improve sock picking, diversification of portfolios and generally, the financial services business for Trade and Ahead
