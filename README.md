-Foodhub: food aggregator company looking to get an idea about the demand of different restaurants which will help them in enhancing their customer experience
-Visualized and analyzed the data and was able to provide insights such as the most profitable cuisines and restaurants, delivery trends during weekends and weekdays and lowest total order time
-Provided recommendations on how to improve ratings and delivery service

**STATISTICAL INFERENCE AND HYPOTHESIS TESTING WITH PYTHON; July 30, 2023
-Performed statistical analysis, a/b testing, and visualization to decide whether the new landing page of an online news portal (E-news Express)
- Utilized python libraries including Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib and Scipy
- Visualized the data, conducted exploratory data analysis and conducted hypothesis testing to address the statistical concerns
- The issues addressed include the decision on which landing page is better, concluding whether language affects the choice of landing page, and deciding which of the pages has a higher conversion rate

  **LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL WITH PYTHON; Aug.27, 2023
  -Built a linear regression model to predict the price of used phones/tablets and identify the influencing factors
  -Utilized python libraries including numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn and statsmodels in order to train the data to identify final linear regression model
  -Key factors that influence pricing were identified and recommendations were offered on how profit can be maximize to benefit the business

  **LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL WITH PYTHON; Sep.24, 2023
  -Built Logistic regression model and decision tree models to predict whether or not a booking will be canceled and identify influencing factors
  - Built a decision tree from the data set, pre-pruned by grid search hyper-parameter tuning and post pruned using minimal cost complexity pruning
  - Identified the key factors influencing the booking status and offered recommendations on policies that can maximize profit in the event of a cancelation
 
    **ENSEMBLE TECHNIQUES (BAGGING, BOOSTING AND STACKING WITH PYTHON); Oct.15, 2023
    -Built various machine learning models including bagging classifier, random forest classifier, adaboost, Gboost, Xgboost and Stacking classifier models to predict whether or not a visa application will be certified
    - Utilized python libraries including numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn and statsmodels
    - Built models from the data, after which the hyper parameters were tuned to get the model with the best performance
